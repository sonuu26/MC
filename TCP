RUN THE CODE---
To run this program in a Colab notebook, you can simply copy and paste the code into a code cell and run the cell. The program will start running and listening for incoming connections on port 8000. You can then connect to the server using a client program that sends data to the server and receives the response. To do this, you can use the telnet command in a separate Colab notebook cell:


!telnet localhost 8000
